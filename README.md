## Project Description

Experience signal analysis through image processing: customize components, mix images, and visualize Fourier transforms instantly in a user-friendly desktop application.

## Features

- #### Image Viewer:
  Open, view, and compare four grayscale images with unified sizing and Fourier Transform (FT) component display for easy analysis.
- #### Output Ports:
  Provide two mirrored viewports for users to control and compare the display of mixed image results.
- #### Brightness/Contrast Adjustment:
   Dynamically adjust image brightness and contrast, including individual component fine-tuning, for precise visualization.
- #### Components Mixer:
  Generate composite images by combining Fourier Transforms of input images with customizable weights via sliders.
- #### Regions Mixer: :
  Select frequency regions (inner/low or outer/high frequencies) on Fourier Transforms, adjustable in size or percentage.
- #### Real-time Mixing:
  Display progress bars during lengthy operations and allow cancellation for swift responsiveness.
